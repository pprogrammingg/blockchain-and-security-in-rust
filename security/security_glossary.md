## When to Use What?

- **ECDSA**: Used in traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- **EdDSA**: Faster and more secure than ECDSA, used in privacy-focused and performance-oriented blockchains (Solana,
  Monero).
- **Schnorr**: Enhances privacy and efficiency, especially for multi-signature transactions (Bitcoin Taproot).
- **BLS**: Used in blockchains that require signature aggregation and threshold cryptography (Ethereum 2.0).
- **Keccak**: The primary hash function used in **Ethereum**, securing transactions, addresses, and Merkle trees.
- **RSA**: Not commonly used in modern blockchains due to large key sizes and inefficiency, but still used in legacy
  cryptographic systems.

# Types of Security Attacks in Blockchain

## **1. Network-Level Attacks**

| Attack             | Description                                                                                                                                                     | Impact                                                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **51% Attack**     | A single entity gains control of more than 50% of the networkâ€™s mining/hash power, allowing them to rewrite transactions, double-spend, and block transactions. | Affects **PoW blockchains** (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic).               |
| **Sybil Attack**   | An attacker creates multiple fake nodes to gain control over a decentralized network.                                                                           | Used to manipulate **P2P networks, voting, and consensus mechanisms**.       |
| **Eclipse Attack** | An attacker isolates a target node by surrounding it with malicious peers, preventing it from seeing the honest network.                                        | Can delay transactions, enable **double-spending** or front-running attacks. |
| **Routing Attack** | Exploits weaknesses in internet infrastructure (ISPs) to intercept blockchain traffic and split the network.                                                    | Can cause **chain forks**, **delayed transactions**, and weaken security.    |

## **2. Consensus-Level Attacks**

| Attack                | Description                                                                                                 | Impact                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Selfish Mining**    | Miners withhold valid blocks to gain an advantage by mining in secret and publishing blocks strategically.  | Reduces network security and **centralizes mining power**.               |
| **Nothing-at-Stake**  | Unique to **PoS blockchains**, validators can validate multiple forks, increasing the risk of chain splits. | Weakens **chain finality** and allows attackers to manipulate consensus. |
| **Long-Range Attack** | Attackers with historical stake can rewrite the blockchain by forking from a much earlier point.            | Affects **PoS blockchains**, breaking **immutability**.                  |

|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reentrancy Attack**          | A malicious contract repeatedly calls back into a vulnerable contract before state changes are finalized. | Used in the **2016 DAO hack** to drain **$60M** from Ethereum.                |
| **Integer Overflow/Underflow** | A math bug where integer values exceed their limit, causing unexpected behavior.                          | Can be used to **steal tokens** or manipulate **contract logic**.             |
| **Front-Running**              | Attackers exploit **pending transactions** by placing their own transactions with higher gas fees.        | Used in **DeFi, MEV (Miner Extractable Value)** to manipulate **DEX trades**. |

| **Governance Attack** | Attackers buy enough governance tokens to manipulate protocol rules or drain treasury funds.                                 | Affects **DAOs and DeFi protocols** (e.g., Beanstalk hack - $182M stolen). |
| **Pump and Dump**     | Market manipulation where prices are artificially inflated before large sell-offs.                                           | Common in **low-liquidity tokens and ICO scams**.                          |

## **How to Defend Against These Attacks**

- **Use robust consensus mechanisms** (e.g., PoS with slashing, hybrid PoW/PoS).
- **Improve smart contract security** by using **formal verification**, audits, and best coding practices.
- **Implement multi-signature wallets** to prevent single-point failures in private key security.
- **Use secure randomness generation** for cryptographic operations.
- **Monitor for suspicious network behavior** (e.g., unusual mining activity, Sybil attacks).
- **Adopt Layer-2 scaling solutions** (e.g., rollups, state channels) to reduce MEV and front-running risks.
