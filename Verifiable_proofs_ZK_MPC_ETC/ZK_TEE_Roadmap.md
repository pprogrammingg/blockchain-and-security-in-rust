# ðŸ§­ ZK + Rust Learning Roadmap

1. ZK Math Foundations (~5-6 weeks)
   Modular arithmetic, quadratic residues, elliptic curves.

Focus on the math relevant to zk circuits (modulo fields, groups).

2. Core ZK Protocols (~6-8 weeks)
   Interactive proofs, Fiat-Shamir heuristic, ZK-SNARKs, ZK-STARKs.

Understand the proving-verifying mindset.

3. Rust Crypto Libraries (~8-10 weeks)
   Study libraries:
   arkworks, bellman, halo2, risc0, zkp.

Build toy circuits (simple range proofs, set membership).

4. Proof Systems & Rust Integration (~10-12 weeks)
   Work with Circom + Rust bindings or fully Rust-native circuits.

Write code to generate proofs and verify them in Rust.

Handle serialization, proof aggregation, efficient circuits.

5. Build Projects (~10-12 weeks)
   Build a small dApp or backend API using zk proofs.

Example: zk-login, anonymous voting, zk asset transfer.

ðŸ”§ Factors that Affect Timeline:
If you can increase weekly hours to ~10 hrs/week â†’ 4-6 months.

Prior cryptography background â†’ faster math ramp-up.

Mentorship or structured cohort â†’ faster progression.

ðŸš€ Fast-Track Tips:
Use Berkeley ZK Bootcamp for structured learning.

Practice with Circom even if you aim for Rust-native later.

Join a ZK Study Group or Discord for peer learning.

Aim to build a small project within 3-4 months to consolidate.
