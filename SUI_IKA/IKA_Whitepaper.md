# Overview

- IKA integrates 2PC-MPC protocol (cutting-edge in Threshold cryptography) alongside DAG based Byzantine consensus by
  Mysticeti as the broadcast channel to achieve decentralized broadcast
- Problems with current interoperability systems:
    - Federated MPC networks could mean few nodes getting control over signing privileges
    - Having to lock assets on one side and have a synthetic wrapped representation on the other side, can open door to
      double-spend and replay attacks.
    - large latency

## dWallet

- Security
    - Building block for decentralized system
    - Programmable infra component where devs can integrate their SMs into
    - Enforce valid signature generation for each account
    - Alice and IKA (Threshold of signers) sign tx using dWallet
    - dWallet signed tx is like a user signed tx in traditional sense
    - dWallet divides private key in to shares managed by the network
    - **Zero trust** option means having the user also participate with the network of signers
- Programmatically:
    - can execute complex tx in collab with SMs
    - can be used for dApp specific behavious: e.g. spend limits, time-locked tx or
      multi-party approval for high-value tx.
    - Examples: DeFi dApp to manage pools on different chains or execution of
      different trade strategies
- Dynamic Participation
    - Network nodes join/leave without impacting network
- Transferability
    - one of the most powerful features is ability to transfer the dWallet
    - dWallet can be transferred to another user or be integrated in an SM
    - e.g. DAO transferring control of treasury wallet to a newly elected gov body
- Operation of dWallet has 2 primary functions:
    - first: DKG
        - DKG - distributed key gen, secret shares of dWallet are cryptographically and securely
          generated by the user and the network
        - Generate public key from which account address on diff chain is derived
        - IKA allows replacing DKG with the import of an existing private key. In this case
          user holds the full original private key. In this scenario, this can not be used in
          where external logic must be enforced (like liquidation).
    - Second: Transaction signing:
        - User collaboartes with IKA network (without re-constructing the full private key)
        - dWallet can respond to and be bound by external logic e.g. from SM

- dWallets are not just securing assets but are programming building blocks working that work with decentralized systems

# 2PC-MPC Protocol

- Uses multi-cast broadcast as opposted to uni-cast to achieve scalability
- USER <-2PC-> IKA <-> MPC <-> Signers (t of n - 2/3)
- Scenario A: user creates 2 shares of secret, keeps one and using homomorephic encryption sends the second
  to the network.
- Scenario B: if user wants to give up their own signing ability (for dWallet to fully take over), user makes the second
  share publicly available so their signature can be re-constructed.

# Efficiencies

- Messaging
    - the broadcast system used as part of Mysticeti - going from O(n^2) to O(n)
    - message batching and amortization
    - Async/Fault Tolerant -> nodes can come in and leave
- Cryptography
    - Pre-computation and pre-signatures
    - DAG
    - Removing proofs from blockchain side and and emulating the 2 party communication in MPC,
      reduces complexity to O(1) from user's perspective

# Security

- Garauntees from 2PC-MPC design
- Identifiable aborts and malicious behaviour
- Publicly verifiable
- Threshold Homo-morphic encryption ensure underlying data are not exposed
- 2PC-MPC gaurantees output even if malicious participants leave mid-session as long
  as threshold of honest participants reach

# Real-World App / Transaction LifeCycle

- User submits partial signature and tx data from dWallet
- Network nodes use pre-computed signatures and user input commnunicate over Mysteciti reliable broadcast channel
  to calculate final signature
- Use created signature to submit tx to valid blockchain target (e.g. Bitcoin) --- process never reconstructs private
  key

# Controlling dWallets with SmartContracts

- dWallets can be used as building blocks of programming due to integration with smart contracts

# Programmable Control and Interoperability

- Smartcontracts and on-chain events can instruct a dWallet to act in a certain way (deposit/withdraw assets)

# Technical Workflow of dWallet vs Smart Contract Interaction

- Example: SUI Move contract controoling dWallet having 10 BTC
- DAO needs majority stakeholders to sign before moving funds
- In order for dWallet generate Bitcoin sig, the state of DAO is shared to show that
  it has the approved transaction

# IKA Security

- Builds on SUI's security
- Relies on Sui's Mysteciti - a BFT protocol that uses DAG to broadcast communication, enabling
  consistent ordering and data availability
- Move language enforces formal verification and resource oriented approach (prevents classic attacks like re-entrance)

# Blockchain / Economy Security

- inherits typical PoS vulnerabilities including collusion (51% attack), dDoS, Long Range Attacks, etc
- IKA relies on latest cryptography including ECDSA, EdDSA and Schnorr
- ...lots to read from different angels

# UseCases

- DeFi -> dWallet automate liquidity management on native blockchain
- Game/NFT , DAOs, Instituitions, Multi-Chain Atomic Swaps,
